Hi Glober!! Here you can find my Docker's repository "juancaarguelles/game_system_db" that contains 
the database used for this challenge, you don't need to worry about the ddl or dml sentences,
once you pull this image and run it, all these queries are executed automatically:

In case you need it:

Database_name=game_store_db
password=
